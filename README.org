Project 13 - Days 52-54 - HackingWithSwift.com/100

** Day 52
Layout of the app and implementing UIImagePickerController() to select an app from the Photo Library.
** Day 53
 - Applying CoreImage filters to UIImages (CIContext & CIFilter).
 - Saving the image back to the iOS Photo Library using UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum()
** Day 54 - Challenges
1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
** Day 58 - Challenge
"Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first."
